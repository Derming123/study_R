"The multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) plays an 
important role in modulating bacterial antibiotic resistance. However, 
the regulatory model of the marRAB operon in mycobacteria remains to be 
characterized. Here we report that a MarR, encoded by Ms6508, and its 
marRAB operon specifically contribute to rifampicin (RIF) resistance in 
Mycobacterium smegmatis. We show that the MarR recognizes a conserved 
21-bp palindromic motif and negatively regulates the expression of two 
ABC transporters in the operon, encoded by Ms6509–6510. Unlike other 
known drug efflux pumps, overexpression of these two ABC transporters 
unexpectedly increased RIF sensitivity and deletion of these two genes 
increased mycobacterial resistance to the antibiotic. No change can be 
detected for the sensitivity of recombinant mycobacterial strains to 
three other anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, HPLC experiments suggested that 
Ms6509–Ms6510 could pump RIF into the mycobacterial cells. These 
findings indicated that the mycobacterial MarR functions as a repressor 
and constitutively inhibits the expression of the marRAB operon, which 
specifically contributes to RIF resistance in M. smegmatis. Therefore, 
our data suggest a new regulatory mechanism of RIF resistance and also 
provide the new insight into the regulatory model of a marRAB operon in 
mycobacteria."
"Transcriptional regulation plays a critical role in the life 
cycle of Mycobacterium smegmatis and its related species, M. 
tuberculosis, the causative microbe for tuberculosis. However, the key 
transcriptional factors involved in broad regulation of diverse genes 
remain to be characterized in mycobacteria. In the present study, a 
TetR-like family transcriptional factor, Ms6564, was characterized in M.
 smegmatis as a master regulator. A conserved 19 bp-palindromic motif 
was identified for Ms6564 binding using DNaseI footprinting and EMSA. A 
total of 339 potential target genes for Ms6564 were further 
characterized by searching the M. smegmatis genome based on the sequence
 motif. Notably, Ms6564 bound with the promoters of 37 cell cycle and 
DNA damage/repair genes and regulated positively their expressions. The 
Ms6564-overexpressed recombinant strain yielded 5-fold lower mutation 
rates and mutation frequencies, whereas deletion of Ms6564 resulted in 
∼5-fold higher mutation rates for the mutant strain compared with the 
wild-type strain. These findings suggested that Ms6564 may function as a
 global regulator and might be a sensor necessary for activation of DNA 
damage/repair genes."
"Transcriptional regulation plays a critical role during the 
infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of 
tuberculosis. A two-component system, PhoPR, is clearly involved in the 
regulation of pathogenic virulence and persistence. However, the 
regulatory mechanism, as well as the regulator, of the phoPR operon 
remains uncharacterized in M. tuberculosis and its related species thus 
far. In the present study, we characterize an ArsR transcriptional 
factor, corresponding to Rv2034 and Ms6762 in M. tuberculosis and 
Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, as the first regulator of phoP in
 both mycobacterial species. The interaction between ArsR regulator and 
target promoters is conserved in these two mycobacterial species, and an
 inverted repeat sequence motif is successfully mapped out for the 
recognition of ArsR. Utilizing lacZ reporter genes and overexpression 
analysis, the ArsR regulator is shown to positively regulate the 
expression of phoP in M. smegmatis, different from most ArsR family 
regulators generally as a repressor. The current study establishes a 
direct link between the ArsR transcriptional factor and the regulation 
of phoP in mycobacteria. Our findings imply that ArsR may be involved in
 the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through its regulation of the phoPR
 operon."
"Clay minerals and metal oxides, as important parts of the soil
 matrix, play crucial roles in the development of microbial communities.
 However, the mechanism underlying such a process, particularly on the 
formation of soil biofilm, remains poorly understood. Here, we 
investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite on 
the biofilm formation of the representative soil bacteria Bacillus 
subtilis. The bacterial biofilm formation in goethite was found to be 
impaired in the initial 24 h but burst at 48 h in the liquid–air 
interface. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm 
biomass in goethite was 3–16 times that of the control, montmorillonite,
 and kaolinite at 48 h. Live/Dead staining showed that cells had the 
highest death rate of 60% after 4 h of contact with goethite, followed 
by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Atomic force microscopy showed that 
the interaction between goethite and bacteria may injure bacterial cells
 by puncturing cell wall, leading to the swarming of bacteria toward the
 liquid–air interface. Additionally, the expressions of abrB and sinR, 
key players in regulating the biofilm formation, were upregulated at 
24 h and downregulated at 48 h in goethite, indicating the initial 
adaptation of the cells to minerals. A model was proposed to describe 
the effects of goethite on the biofilm formation. Our findings may 
facilitate a better understanding of the roles of soil clays in biofilm 
development and the manipulation of bacterial compositions through 
controlling the biofilm in soils. The effect of three soil minerals on 
biofilm production is clarified by research using the common soil 
bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The mineral composition of soil is known to
 affect biofilm production, but the mechanisms underpinning minerals’ 
influences have not been well studied. Peng Cai and colleagues at 
Huazhong Agricultural University in China, with co-workers in the United
 States and Singapore, studied Bacillus subtilis growing in the presence
 of the minerals montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite. Their results
 suggest the minerals, especially goethite, can encourage biofilm 
formation by promoting the bursting of bacterial cells. The effect of 
goethite was attributed to the size of its grains being generally 
smaller than the bacterial cells. By quantifying the effect of these 
minerals, the research will assist understanding of biofilm formation 
and the growth and persistence of bacterial populations in soils."
"The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent 
of tuberculosis, encodes a large number of putative transcriptional 
regulators. However, the identity and target genes of only a few of them
 have been clearly identified to date. In a recent study, the ArsR 
family regulator Rv2034 was characterized as a novel positive regulator 
of phoP. In the current study, we characterized the auto-repressive 
capabilities of Rv2034 and identified several residues in the protein 
critical for its DNA binding activities. We also provide evidence that 
Rv2034 forms dimers in vitro. Furthermore, by using DNaseI footprinting 
assays, a palindromic sequence was identified as its binding site. 
Notably, we found that the dosR promoter region contains the binding 
motif for Rv2034, and that Rv2034 positively regulates the expression of
 the dosR gene. The potential roles of Rv2034 in the regulation of lipid
 metabolism and hypoxic adaptation are discussed."
"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems play significant roles in the 
regulation of bacterial growth and persistence, and their functions 
usually depend on protein-protein interaction between their constituent 
TA proteins. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these systems, 
particularly their interaction with other cellular components, are still
 poorly understood. This study investigated cross-talk between the TA 
module RelJ/K (Rv3357/Rv3358) and the transcriptional regulator 
staphylococcal iron regulator repressor (SirR, Rv2788) from 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We characterized the physical 
interaction of SirR with both RelJ and RelK using bacterial two-hybrid, 
pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Similarly to RelK, SirR 
regulates the DNA-binding activity of RelJ and alleviates its inhibitory
 effect on the activity of the Rv3357p promoter. Furthermore, SirR may 
replace RelJ to alleviate the inhibitory effect of the toxin RelK on 
bacterial growth. Conversely, both RelJ and RelK competitively inhibit 
the interaction between SirR and their respective promoters. Thus, our 
results show that SirR interacts with a pair of toxin and antitoxin 
proteins, and exhibits antitoxin-like function to neutralize the toxin. 
These findings demonstrate a novel function of the SirR regulator of 
M. tuberculosis as well as a novel mechanism of regulation of TA 
systems.

"Bacterial natural products (NPs) are considered to be a 
promising source of drug discovery. However, the biosynthesis gene 
clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to 
identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria 
may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, 
implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social 
behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient 
workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial 
social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, 
transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant 
species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated 
soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm 
communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this 
strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis
 of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete 
genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel 
non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were 
predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. 
Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. 
G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species 
can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the 
soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics.
 As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to 
the discovery of new antibiotics."

"Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors have 
widespread biological significance in the regulation of gene expression.
 However, in lower prokaryotes and eukaryotic metazoans, it is usually 
difficult to find transcription regulatory factors that recognize 
specific target promoters. To address this, we have developed in this 
study a new bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector system that provides a 
convenient and rapid strategy to determine the specific interaction 
between target DNA sequences and their transcription factors. Using this
 system, we have successfully determined the DNA-binding specificity of 
the transcription regulator Rv3133c to a previously reported promoter 
region of the gene Rv2031 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we
 have tested more than 20 promoter regions of M. tuberculosis genes 
using this approach to determine if they interact with approximately 150
 putative regulatory proteins. A variety of transcription factors are 
found to participate in the regulation of stress response and fatty acid
 metabolism, both of which comprise the core of in vivo-induced genes 
when M. tuberculosis invades macrophages. Interestingly, among the many 
new discovered potential transcription factors, the WhiB-like 
transcriptional factor WhiB3 was identified for the first time to bind 
with the promoter sequences of most in vivo-induced genes. Therefore, 
this study offers important data in the dissection of the transcription 
regulations in M. tuberculosis, and the strategy should be applicable in
 the study of DNA-binding factors in a wide range of biological 
organisms."
"Bacterial social interaction is a potential influencing factor
 in determining the fate of invading pathogens in diverse environments. 
In this study, interactions between two representative resident species 
(Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida) and a leading food-borne 
disease causative pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were examined. An 
antagonistic effect toward V. parahaemolyticus was observed for B. 
subtilis but not for P. putida. However, the relative richness of the 
pathogen remained rather high in B. subtilis co-cultures and was, 
unexpectedly, not sensitive to the initial inoculation ratios. 
Furthermore, two approaches were found to be efficient at modulating the
 relative richness of the pathogen. (1) The addition of trace glycerol 
and manganese to Luria-Bertani medium (LBGM) reduced the richness of V. 
parahaemolyticus in the co-culture with B. subtilis and in contrast, 
increased its richness in the co-culture with P. putida, although it did
 not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus by its own. (2) The 
relative richness of V. parahaemolyticus on semisolid medium decreased 
significantly as a function of an agar gradient, ranging from 0 to 2%. 
Furthermore, we explored the molecular basis of bacterial interaction 
through transcriptomic analysis. In summary, we investigated the 
interactions between a pathogen invader and two resident bacteria 
species, showing that the different influences on a pathogen by 
different types of interactions can be modulated by chemicals and medium
 fluidity."
"The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats [CRISPR]-CRISPR associated proteins [Cas]) system 
can provide prokaryote with immunity against invading mobile genetic 
elements (MGEs) such as phages and plasmids, which are the main sources 
of staphylococcal accessory genes. To date, only a few Staphylococcus 
aureus strains containing CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, but 
no functional study in these strains has been reported. In this study, 6
 clinical isolates of S. aureus with type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems were 
identified, and whole-genome sequencing and functional study were 
conducted subsequently. Genome sequence analysis revealed a close 
linkage between the CRISPR-Cas system and the staphylococcal cassette 
chromosome mec (SCCmec) element in five strains. Comparative sequence 
analysis showed that the type III-A repeats are conserved within 
staphylococci, despite of the decreased conservation in trailer-end 
repeats. Highly homologous sequences of some spacers were identified in 
staphylococcal MGEs, and partially complementary sequences of spacers 
were mostly found in the coding strand of lytic regions in 
staphylococcal phages. Transformation experiments showed that S. aureus 
type III-A CRISPR-Cas system can specifically prevent plasmid transfer 
in a transcription-dependent manner. Base paring between crRNA and 
target sequence, the endoribonuclease, and the Csm complex were proved 
to be necessary for type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity."

"The risk of enteropathogens to food and water is highly 
dependent on their survival in soil environments. Here, the effects of 
soil type, particle size, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) 
or Fe/Al (hydro)oxides on pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 survival 
in sterilized soil particles were assessed through survival, attachment,
 metabolic activity, and qRT-PCR analyses. The abundance of inoculated 
E. coli O157:H7 in Brown soil (Alfisol) particles increased 0.6–1.4 
log10 CFU/g within 3 days (except for NOM-stripped clay), while that in 
Red soil (Ultisol) particles decreased rapidly in 8 days 
post-inoculation. Additionally, survival of bacteria was significantly 
enhanced when Fe/Al (hydro)oxides had been removed from Red soil 
particles. For the two soils, E. coli O157:H7 survived the longest in 
NOM-present clays and the bacterial adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) 
levels were 0.7–2.0 times greater in clays than in sands and silts on 
day 8. Moreover, clays were more effective than silts and sands in 
binding cells and changing the expressions of acetate pathway-associated
 genes (pta and ackA). For silts and sands, E. coli O157:H7 decayed more
 rapidly in the presence of NOM and similar trends of bacterial ATP 
levels were observed between NOM-stripped and NOM-present soil 
particles, indicating that the primary role of NOM was not as a nutrient
 supply. These findings indicate that soil particles function mainly 
through attachment to change the metabolic pathway of E. coli O157:H7 
and ultimately impact the survival of bacterial pathogens in soils."
